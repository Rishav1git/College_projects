This is the Mini Project by me 
In this i made a PES HOSPITAL website 

Which have the functionalites like:
1. Calling Ambulance 
2. Book Ampointment 
3. See the Doctor Details
4. Access Admin Page(By pressing PES logo)
5. see the Details of Ambulance reuqest ,Appointment Details And able to take action

Developed Using MERN stack

Requirments to run this 
Node js, react app , mongodb, express (Node js and all other intallation to be done carefully to run this otherwise it may give errors)

For Running server Requirments installation commands
npm i mongodb
npm i express
npm i  cors

some instruction for mongodb
connected to mongodb Using localhost27017 
u have to create admin collection other collection will be created automatically when u rin the server and put some data into it
it is advisable to craete database with name User yourself

for client side some installation commands(may be some installation commands are missed)
npm i react-router-dom (check with the version of this this is the version used in november 2023)

to start the website run command 
npm start (pes hospital folder)
for starting server
node server.js(inside the server folder)

Note : This is the Mini Project so realwebsite functionalites and design may vary

SOME INSTRUCTION AT THE TIME OF BUILDING REACT APP GIVEN BY SYSTEM

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
