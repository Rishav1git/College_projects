This is a Mini Project Made by me
In this i made a simple maze solver using graphs traversal method

//Data structure used:
1. queue 
2. graphs(BFS TRAVERSAL)


//Hard Coded for maze solver input 
    /*char* maze[] = {
        "S.#...",
        "..#.#.",
        ".#..#.",
        ".....#",
        "#.#...",
        ".#..E."
    };
    int rows = 6;  
    int cols = 6; 
    struct Point start = { 0, 0 }; 
    struct Point end = { 5, 5 }; */

Here( '#' refers to wall , '.'refers to path)

Note : This is Just the Mini project so  real maze solver functionalities may vary from This
