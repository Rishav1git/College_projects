This is a Mini Project Made by me
In this i have used ply tool for validating the syntax of C#  Language 

syntax validation is done for:
1. loops
2. array declartion
3. data type declaration
4. function declaration
5. operator

To run this you need to have ply tool and python in your system installed

To intsall ply tool : pip install ply(consider pip command and ur system should be updated)

Note: This is Just a Mini Project So real syntax validator or Compiler design will Vary
